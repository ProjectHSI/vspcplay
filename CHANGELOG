-- v1.3
  Added command line options to replace the unused bytes in a spc file by a given pattern. By doing
  this you can increase compressibility of files:
    --apply_mask_block  Apply the mask to the file (replace unused blocks(256 bytes) with pattern)
    --apply_mask_byte   Apply the mask to the file (replace unused bytes with pattern)
	--filler val        Set the pattern byte value. Use with the 2 options above. Default 0 

-- v1.2
  Added --status_line command line option (displays a status line in the
  terminal).
  Reads in the sample directory were not reported (Resulting in unusable
  masks)

  Win32 support, compiled with mingw
