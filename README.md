# vspcplay, a visual spc player and optimisation tool

![vspcplay screenshot](/screenshots/playing.png?raw=true "vspcplay")

## Overview

This is vspcplay, a visual spc player and optimisation tool.

I used the code from the spc-xmms plugin, which uses the snes9x APU emulation
code. I updated the snes9x code using a newer version of snes9x (I dont remember
which version exactly).

The display code is mine.

** WARNING **
I coded this really fast and added feature after feature without any planning and minimal
thinking. The code is really *really* ugly.


## Compilation

 * libsdl1.2
 * gcc and g++
 * make

If all goes well, a single executable named vspcplay will be generated.

## Authors

## License

This work is derived from the Snes9x code, to which the Snes9x license applies.
See the header of spc700.cpp for details.
